NExtGen
=======

_Nautilus Extension Generator_

**NExtGen** is an interactive Bash script that lets you easily set up a new
extension project for **GNOME Files** (formerly **Nautilus**).

All you have to do is to launch the `nextgen.sh` script and answer a few
questions. For any issue, [drop a message][1].


Installation
------------

The `nextgen.sh` script does not need to be installed in order to function. If
you wish anyway to have a copy of it permanently installed on your machine,
launch:

``` sh
./configure
make install
```

If the `configure` script is missing you will need to generate it by launching
`autoreconf -i` from the top level directory of the package (**GNU Autotools**
is required).


Free software
-------------

**NExtGen** is free software. You can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GPL license version 3 or any later version. See [COPYING][2]
for details.
