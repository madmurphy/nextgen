NExtGen
=======

_Nautilus Extension Generator_

**NExtGen** is an interactive Bash script that lets you easily set up a new
extension project for **GNOME Files**.

All you have to do is to launch the `nextgen.sh` script (without arguments) and
answer a few questions. If you want to run the script in unattended mode (`-u`) you
can edit the following template command:

``` sh
./nextgen.sh -u foo-bar 'A sample extension for GNOME Files' 0.1.0 'John Doe' \
	john.doe 'john.doe@example.org' '1, 2, 5'
```

For any issue, please [drop a message][1].


Installation
------------

The `nextgen.sh` script does not need to be installed in order to function. If
you wish anyway to have a copy of it permanently installed on your machine,
launch:

``` sh
./configure
make install
```

If the `configure` script is missing you will need to generate it by launching
`autoreconf -i` from the top level directory of the package (**GNU Autotools**
is required).


Free software
