NExtGen

_Nautilus Extension Generator_

**NExtGen** is a Bash script that lets you easily set up a new extension
project for GNOME's Nautilus file manager.

All you have to do is to launch the `nextgen.sh` script and answer a few
questions. For any issue, [drop me a message][1].

Good luck! ;)


Installation
------------

The `nextgen.sh` script does not need to be installed in order to function.
However, if you wish to have a copy of it permanently installed in your
machine, launch:

``` sh
./configure
make install
```

If the `configure` script is missing you will need to generate it by launching
`autoreconf -i` from the top level directory of the package (**GNU Autotools**
is required).
