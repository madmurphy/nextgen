INSTALL
=======

The `nextgen.sh` script does not need to be installed in order to function. If
you wish anyway to have a copy of it permanently installed on your machine,
launch:

``` sh
./configure
make install
```

If the `configure` script is missing you will need to generate it by launching
`autoreconf -i` from the top level directory of the package (**GNU Autotools**
is required).
